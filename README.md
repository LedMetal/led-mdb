# LedMDB

## [LIVE](https://ledmdb.abdulsadiq.com/) (Work in Progress)

## Description

In 2019, my wife and I decided to make a record of every single movie we watched that year. The reason for this was to collect a real dataset to use when practicing creating apps, like **LedMDB**! Take a browse around at the movies we watched. Click on one that you wish to see more information on! You can start by selecting a month in the filters section!

## Development

There are two sources of data used in **LedMDB**. The first is the watched movies list and the second is the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/), which is used to get movie information.

OMDB is an open movie database which provides a RESTful service to developers through their API. I chose to use this API to get detailed information on each movie, as well as the official poster image to use as well. **LedMDB** uses all these to create my own movie database for the movies watched in one full calendar year. A fun and invested means of practicing APIs, observables, and Angular best practices.

## Built With

_Programming Language:_ **Angular**, **Typescript**, **SCSS**
